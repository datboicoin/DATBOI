0x76914ca27f3c7422a14c22aaeafbbd05d3f3526b

OH SHIT WADDUP
It is DATBOI on the BLOCKCHAIN

Completing the meme trifecta, DatBoiCoin Rockets into last place behind Dogecoin, PepeCash, monacoin, nyancoin, and coinye.
Unlike The other memecoins, DatBoiCoin is a TOKEN, which RUNS on the ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN.
ITS THE FIRST TOKEN BUILT ON THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM THAT HAS NO VALUE

What is DatBoiCoin? well it is NOT a currency! it is a token, OF DATBOI! 

DatBoiCoin is not for transacting!

ITS A SMART CONTRACT MEMETOKENCOIN

How many BOIS are out there? 100 BILLION BOIS

This is the same amount as dogecoin, but even better, because it has more decimal places, 10^-18 !!!!!!!!

Unlike dogecoin, DatBoi is all available at once, flooding the market with useless tokens, to ensure next to nothing value.

DatBoiCoin follows the SON model, which stands for Store-Of-Nothing.

If DatBoi is to adhere to the SON model, the value of an individual coin will never be worth more then the price of an ethereum transaction
creating a net negative, or at worst, a net zero.

If keeping with tradition of Dogecoin, DatBoiCoin would have been implemented as a traditional cryptocurrency,
with miners hashing on the scrypt algorithm to generate a chain of transactions.
This approach is not favorable to DatBoiCoin, as it is not minimum effort possible.

If DatBoiCoin intends to follow the SON model, mining might create something of value and this must be avoided. 

DatBoiCoin has no mining, no block reward, no scaling debate. It is just low quality, low effort memecoin
built on the decentralized ethereum platform.

Even though DatBoiCoin is built on Ethereum, it uses Polulz algorithm for coin distribution.

POLULZ stands for Proof of lulz. If you have DatBoi, you are in it for the lulz.

How does the Contract work?

The contract created 100,000,000,000 coins and sent them to the DatBoiCoin Mint Address.

All originally minted coins are available for trade and come out of the 100 Billion total supply.

After the contract is created, no more coins can be brought into or taken out of existence. DATBOI IS FOREVER

DatBoiCoin will fall out of circulation every time you guys lose them or forget they exist. 

the same will also take place as people take their datboi to the grave. DATBOI IS FOREVER


To get ahold of this non-currency, send less then 0.1 ETH to the contract address.

The contract will award the ETH sender with DATBOI.

To add a custom token, go to My EtherWallet.com or metamask and Plug in this Information in the custom token section:

Contract Address: 0x76914ca27f3c7422a14c22aaeafbbd05d3f3526b

Token Symbol: DATBOI

Decimals: 18


The contract awards 1000 DATBOI per 0.00001 ETH, about 1 US cent at time of writing.


I did this for a few reasons, 
1) For 0.001 ETH(currently ~$1.0) you get 100,000 DATBOI. With this amount of DATBOI you now have BOIS for life.
   IF you posted 1 meme every day for the next 100 years, you would have 1/3 less memes then you now have DATBOI. SUPER LOW EFFORT
   
2) For 0.01 ETH(currently ~$10) Mr. bigspender gets 1,000,000 DATBOI. This is a great wealth of BOIS, a gluttony of DATBOI. Nobody ever needs this many BOIS.  

3) If someone sent more then 0.1 ETH to the contract, the contract will fail. This gives you a minute to think about what your about to do.

4) If someone came along with lots of ETH and bought DatBoiCoin until DatBoi Mint had run out of tokens, distribution would not be fair.

5) At 100 Billion DATBOIS with 1000 DATBOI/0.00001 ETH, the contract is worth 1000 ETH.
    IT IS WORTH ONLY YOUR LULZ AND A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF BOIS, NOTHING MORE
    
   Setting the price NEXT to nothing allows accessibility which creates a more fair distribution so everyone can get SOMA DATBOOOIIII ohshitwaddup
    
6) If you send DatBoi to the Contract, ETH does not come out. The transaction is not reversible, you are now a bagholder, congradulations!

The Ether collected from the DATBOI crowdsale will be put towards the creation of dank memes and the development of the dank meme network.
the DANK network stands for Decentralized Autonomous Nuked Kernal which already has a raspberry pi slaving away to generate low effort deep fried memes.

In the future, users will be able to morph cryptographically secure memes together with other sources of low effort content, 
deep frying the combo to create a new meme in the process, instantly registered on the blockchain. 
THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT FOR BLOCKCHAIN POWERED MEMEING

Some final comments:
DatBoi Mint cannot modify the contract. No values can be passed and the price cannot be changed.  
The contract has been posted to the git as the .sol file, under MIT license. Use it to help usher in the new era of shitcoins.
